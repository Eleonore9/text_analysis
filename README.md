Text analysis project
=============

Idea:
----
* Letters: plot and compare the frequencies of each alphabet letters in novels 
written in different languages. Use of Pandas and Matplotlib.

* Words: compare the use of certain words in novels over time. Use of Matplotlib and nltk.

Progress:
--------

Python class to perform the cleaning of Gutenberg books.

* Letters:
1. Script to get counts and frequencies.
2. Using Pandas (with Matplotlib and ggplot) to visualise letters frequencies in
three books (English languages):

My iPython notebook:
![plotting_letters_frequencies] (https://raw.github.com/Eleonore9/text_analysis/master/text_analysis.png)

* Words: basic script for counts and frequencies. On hold until the part on 
"Letter" is over.
