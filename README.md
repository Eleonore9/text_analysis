Text analysis project
=============

Idea:
----
* Letters: plot and compare the frequencies of each alphabet letters in novels 
written in different languages. Use of Numpy, SciPy and Matplotlib.
* Words: compare the use of certain words in novels over time. Use of Numpy, 
SciPy, Matplotlib and nltk.

Progress:
--------
* Letters: basic use of NumPy and Matplotlib to plot letters frequencies in
Alice in Wonderland. Currently improving "count_words_letters_class.py" so the
notebook is broken but it used to display as follows:
![plotting_letters_frequencies] (https://raw.github.com/Eleonore9/text_analysis/master/text_analysis.png)
* Words: basic script for counts and frequencies. On hold until the part on 
"Letter" is over.
