Text analysis project
=============

Idea:
----
* Letters: plot and compare the frequencies of each alphabet letters in novels 
written in different languages. Use of Pandas and Matplotlib.

* Words: compare the use of certain words in novels over time. Use of Matplotlib and nltk.

Progress:
--------

Python class to perform the cleaning of Gutenberg books.

* Letters:
  1. Script to get counts and frequencies.
  2. Using Pandas (with Matplotlib and ggplot) to visualise letters frequencies in
three books (English language):

[My iPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Eleonore9/text_analysis/blob/master/Test_textanalysis.py.ipynb)

* Words: basic script for counts and frequencies. On hold until the part on 
"Letters" is over.
