Text analysis project
=============

Idea:
----
* Letters: plot and compare the frequencies of each alphabet letters in novels
written in different languages. Use of Pandas and Matplotlib.

* Words: compare the use of certain words in novels over time. Use of Matplotlib and nltk.

Progress:
--------

Python class to perform the cleaning of Gutenberg books.

* Letters:
  1. Script to get counts and frequencies.
  2. Using Pandas in a Jupyter notebook to analyse and visualise letters frequencies in three books (English language):
  ![img_bar_plot](https://raw.github.com/Eleonore9/text_analysis/master/imgs/letters_freqs.png)
  3. Still using Pandas in a notebook to compare letters frequencies in Englissh books versus French books:
  ![en_vs_fr](https://raw.github.com/Eleonore9/text_analysis/master/imgs/en_vs_fr.png)

* Words: basic script for counts and frequencies. On hold until the part on
"Letters" is over.
